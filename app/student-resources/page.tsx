              What JNTUK RESULTS is (and is not)

            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              JNTUK RESULTS is an <strong>independent</strong> web portal built to help students
              access and understand examination outcomes faster. We provide tools such as academic
              results, consolidated views, backlog summaries, credit checks, notifications, and
              optional grace-marks helpers. We are <strong>not</strong> affiliated with JNTUK, your
              college, or any government body. For official decisions—promotion, degree award,
              scholarships, or placements—you must rely on{" "}
              <strong>original grade cards, memos, and circulars</strong> issued by the university
              and your institution.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              When you use our tools, data is typically fetched on demand from connected services so
              you can view it in a clear layout. That does not replace the legal value of a signed
              official document. If you find a mismatch, always follow the examination branch’s
              correction process.

              Regulations (R16, R19, R20, R23)—why they matter
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              JNTUK offers several curriculum regulations over time (R16, R19, R20, and R23; R20 is current for the 2022 regular batch). Your
              regulation defines <strong>credit structure</strong>, <strong>evaluation scheme</strong>,
              and sometimes <strong>grace-mark rules</strong>. Two students in different regulations
              may have different subject codes, credit totals, or promotion criteria even if their
              branch name looks similar.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              Before comparing results with friends, confirm you are on the same regulation and
              programme. Our portal aims to reflect the data returned for your hall ticket; if a
              semester is missing, it may still be under processing or not released for your batch on
              the upstream system.

              Your hall ticket is a unique identifier printed on admit cards and often used on result
              portals. Enter it carefully—<strong>wrong digits</strong> can show another student’s
              data or fail to load. Do not share it publicly in chats or social posts; treat it like
              a roll number tied to your academic identity.

            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              <strong>SGPA</strong> summarises one semester. <strong>CGPA</strong> combines multiple
              semesters according to your regulation’s rules. <strong>Credits</strong> measure how
              much weight each subject carries toward your degree requirements. Failing a high-credit
              core subject can sometimes affect your progression more than a low-credit elective.

              Our Credits Checker and result views help you <em>estimate</em> standing, but your

              are final. Use our numbers to plan; use your handbook and counsellors to confirm
              eligibility.

              <strong>Revaluation</strong> (including RC/RV where applicable) has strict windows.
              Applying late usually means waiting for the next cycle. Our tools may show RCRV-related
              outcomes when they exist in the returned data; always keep payment receipts and
              acknowledgement slips from the university.

            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              A backlog means you have not yet earned a pass in a required subject. Backlogs are
              common; what matters is a realistic plan: which supplies to attempt first, how they
              interact with prerequisites, and whether your target graduation year still works.
              Our Backlog Report is meant to give a structured view—pair it with advice from your
